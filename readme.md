# Harvard CS50

### This will function as a living document of my experience working through the Harvard CS50 course on edx.org
### To start we reviewed the concepts around binary, ASCII, procedural thinking, and abstraction.

## Intro to C language!
#### '#' tells the compilier to run this first used for include statements. Never implicitly declare something without the header file for the libraries you are using. 
#### all source code must be compiled before being ran. there are several ways to do this, make being the most easy, however I encountered errors with running make with the cs50 library on my personal machine as opposed to in the cs50 sandbox. using clang and gcc commands with specific instructions I am able to compile and run with minimal errors. Moving forward, when writing my own C programs, I will not use the cs50 library.
#### When you encounter an error in the cs50 sandbox, if you preface your make statement with help50, there may be advice from the staff that can help you in reading your error messages.
