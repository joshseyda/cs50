# Harvard CS50
## Intro to C language!
### This will function as a living document of my experience working through the Harvard CS50 course on edx.org
#### '#' tells the compilier to run this first used for include statements
#### all source code must be compiled before being ran. there are several ways to do this, make being the most easy, however I encountered errors with running make with the cs50 library. using clang and gcc commands with specific instructions I am able to compile and run with minimal errors. Moving forward, when writing my own C programs, I will not use the cs50 library.
